# Awesome European Tech ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

There is an increasing demand to support European startups and companies that opt not to move their headquarters to the U.S. or other regions. Making Europe's tech sector stronger and boosting its economy are key steps to encourage innovation. European software and companies often follow different standards than those in the U.S, many of which also provide benefits to users. For instance:

- **GDPR Compliance**: European companies are required to adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which guarantees stricter data privacy and security for users compared to U.S. standards. This has established a global benchmark for data protection.

- **Sustainability Standards**: Numerous European companies emphasize eco-friendly practices, such as utilizing renewable energy or minimizing carbon footprints, which align with the EUâ€™s Green Deal initiatives.

Below is a list of recommended European products curated by the community. Before diving into the list, itâ€™s worth checking out the following website that inspired this project: [European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu/). Contributions are welcome, and anyone can submit a pull request to help expand the list.

**Disclaimer**: This project does not imply avoiding products from outside Europe. There are many outstanding global tools that are widely used and appreciated. The goal of this list is not to divide but to support European startups and projects that prioritize privacy, sustainability, and innovation. The aim is to strengthen the European tech ecosystem while fostering collaboration and inclusivity across borders. Together, we can build a more diverse and resilient global tech landscape.
